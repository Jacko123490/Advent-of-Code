# Advent of Code Solutions
Just a small repo to mark my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
challenges provided at the end of the year. 
Each year's solutions are listed under that years directory, with a separate script to solve each day's solutions.
Each script can just be ran as-is to generate the solution for each day. (Package dependencies should be minimal)
